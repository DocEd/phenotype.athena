# phenotype.athena

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of phenotype.athena is to allow a researcher to use their preferred clinical ontology to traverse the athena vocabularies in order to collect related terms for clinical phenotyping.
This may be of use if one already has a validated clinical phenotype in a particular language, but you need it in another.
This process makes use of the Athena vocabularies provided by OHDSI.

## Installation

You can install the released version of phenotype.athena from [github](https://www.github.com/DocEd/phenotype.athena) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("DocEd/phenotype.athena")
```
## Setting Up Athena

### Prerequisites

- `R` (`R` is mandatory, R Studio is useful)
- A download of the vocabularies you would like to use from (Athena)[http://athena.ohdsi.org/]
- A PC with at least 8Gb of memory (moving the OMOP vocabularies through memory is the main bottleneck). If this is a problem, please let me know and I will optimise to mitigate this issue. You could also load the vocabularies yourself separately.

Please setup your working directly with the following folder structure:

```
|--vocab/
    |--CONCEPT_ANCESTOR.csv
    |--CONCEPT.csv
    |--CONCEPT_SYNONYM.csv
    |--DRUG_STRENGTH.csv
    |--VOCABULARY.csv
    |--CONCEPT_CLASS.csv
    |--CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP.csv
    |--DOMAIN.csv
    |--RELATIONSHIP.csv
```

Try to keep the `vocab` folder for your vocabularies only.

### Vocabulary Recommendations

I recommend using the following vocabularies. You can download the following vocabularies from [athena](https://athena.ohdsi.org/), and add them to your project vocabulary folder:

- 1	SNOMED
- 6 LOINC
- 8	RxNorm
- 12 Gender
- 13 Race
- 14 CMS Place of Service
- 34 ICD10
- 44 Ethnicity
- 55 OPCS4
- 57 HES Specialty
- 75 dm+d
- 82 RxNorm Extension
- 87 Specimen Type
- 111 Episode Type
- 115 Provider
- 116 Supplier

### Omopification

You can now run the vocabulary loader by calling:

```r
library(phenotype.athena)

# database_name will be the filename of the SQLite datbase.

stand_up_omop(
  project_path = ".",
  cdm_version =  "5.3.1",
  vocabulary_version = "5",
  database_name = "decovid_omop.sqlite",
  database_engine = "sqlite"
)
```

If all goes well. You should now have a lovely Athena setup.
Enjoy these magical good times.

## Phenotyping

Establish a connection to the database, check which vocabularies are availible
and perform a search.

```r
# Connect to the database
ctn <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "path_to_the_database")
available_vocabularies(ctn)

# Use the codes for "diabetes" from ICD-10

phenotype_athena(
  ctn,
  concept_codes = c("E10", "E11", "E12", "O242"),
  source_vocabulary = "ICD10", # Needs to be in the same format as shown by `available_vocabularies()`
  )
```
